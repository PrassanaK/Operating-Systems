In order to compile, type "make" to compile the program using the makefile
This will create an executable file called "program"

In order to run this program type: ./program m
m is the number which indicates the size of the buffer. I was unable to implement t, the time taken for each request.

Although a segmentation fault occurs, the program still partially works.
If you get an abort message, simply run the program again.
